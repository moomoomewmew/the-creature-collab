### MVP 
* Be a new repo with separate development branches for each group member.
* Be a realistic idea. It cannot be anything we've created in class. It also cannot be from an online tutorial or walkthrough.
* Include a beautiful, professional ReadMe.md (use markdown).
* Your ReadMe should have your group members names, links to socials, a detailed description of your project, technologies used, a getting started section (with * links to your deployed site and Trello), screenshots of your final product (no more than 2-3), future updates, and credits.
* Include a minimum of 3 Sequelize Models (models).
* At least one 1 to MANY or MANY to MANY association.
* Have full CRUD operations (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE) on at least one model.
* Use functional components with React hooks. Your project cannot have class components.
* Have at least 60 meaningful git commits - roughly 20 per member utilizing branches and merging. You should be committing your changes to your branch every time you build a new feature, merging, and pulling them as a group.
* Your code should be properly indented, spaced, and within code blocks. DO NOT leave in commented out code that was left unused (bad practice).
* Be deployed on Heroku.
