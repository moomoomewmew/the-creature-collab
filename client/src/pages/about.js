      <p>

        In these times of isolation, the hero's journey can feel exccedingly
        lonesome. Our collective brain child was born from the desire to find
        fellow fantasy enthusiasts and forge friendships based on shared
        interests in all things fictional and fun. Our cast of characters
        include:
        <li className="Katie">Katie, our fearless Gatekeeper</li>
        <li className="Randall">Randall, our Creative Conjurer</li>
        <li className="Benjamin">Benjamin, our Human Room of Requirement</li>
        <li className="Charlie">And Charlie, our Developer Druid</li>
      </p>
    </div>
