      <h1>Our Community Guidelines</h1>
      <p>
        Our goal is to make Creature Collab accessible, safe, and enjoyable for
        everyone. As such, we ask that our users abide by the following
        guidelines:
      </p>
      <h3> NEVER GIVE OUT YOUR REAL, PERSONAL INFORMATION ONLINE.</h3>
      <p>
        This is a platform for fictional characters to interact. As for your
        real-life identity-in the wise words of Gandalf-"Keep it secret; keep it
        safe."
      </p>
      <h3>When attending events, exercise common sense.</h3>
      <p>
        Go with a friend, or let a roommate, relative, or other trusted human
        know where you are going, and when you plan to return. Arrange check-in
        times with said human.
      </p>
      <h3>Creature Collab is an inclusive environment for all Creatures.</h3>
      <p>
        Be kind and respectful in all your interactions with other characters,
        both online and in-person. Creature Collab does not tolerate bullying,
        harrassment, trolling, or bigotry of any kinds. Violators will be exiled
        from Creature Collab. Please report any incidents of harm and/or
        violence of these kinds to an admin.
      </p>
      <h3>Help Make Creature Collab Accessible! </h3>
      <p>
        When planning events, please take into consideration the diverse needs
        of different users to keep your events open to all. For example, is the
        venue of your in-person event accessible for wheelchair users? What
        about options for social distancing? Do you have closed captions on your
        online event? These are just some of the ways you can help us make
        Creature Collab enjoyable for all!
