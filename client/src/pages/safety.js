            <p>Our goal for this app is that all creatures great and small would enjoy building friendships with one another in a safe and welcoming environment.As such, we ask that our users please observe the following precautions:</p>
            <li>NEVER GIVE OUT YOUR REAL, PERSONAL INFORMATION ONLINE. This is a platform for fictional characters to interact. As for your real-life identity-in the wise words of Gandalf-"Keep it secret; keep it safe."</li>
            <li>When attending events, exercise common sense-go with a friend, or let a roommate, relative, or other trusted human know where you are going, and when you plan to return. Arrange check-in times with said human.</li>
