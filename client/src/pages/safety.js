      <h1>Our Community Guidelines</h1>
      <p>
        Our goal is to make Creature Collab accessible, safe, and enjoyable for
        everyone. As such, we ask that our users abide by the following
        guidelines:
      </p>
      <h3> NEVER GIVE OUT YOUR REAL, PERSONAL INFORMATION ONLINE.</h3>
      <p>
        {' '}
        Creature Collab is designed as a fantasy realm for our favorite
        fictional friends. We ask that you remain in character when interacting
        through our platform. As for your real-life identity-in the wise words
        of Gandalf-"Keep it secret; keep it safe."
      </p>
      <h3>When attending events, practice common sense!</h3>
      <p>
        Go with a friend, or let a roommate, relative, or other trusted human
        know where you are going, and when you plan to return. Arrange check-in
        times with said human.
      </p>
      <h3>Creature Collab is an inclusive environment for all Creatures.</h3>
      <p>
        Be kind and respectful in all your interactions with other characters,
        both online and in-person. Creature Collab does not tolerate bullying,
        harrassment, trolling, or bigotry of any kinds. Violators will be exiled
        from Creature Collab. Please report any incidents of harm and/or
        violence of these kinds to an admin.
      </p>
      <h3>Help Make Creature Collab Accessible! </h3>
      <p>
        When planning events, please take into consideration the diverse needs
        of different users to keep your events open to all. For example, is the
        venue of your in-person event accessible for wheelchair users? What
        about options for social distancing? Do you have closed captions
        available for your online event? These are just some of the ways you can
        help us make Creature Collab enjoyable for all! Furthermore, if you have
        suggestions on making Creature Collab more accessible, please be sure to
        let an admin know!
      </p>
      <h3>Keep Creature Collab Fun For All!</h3>
      <p>
        Please refrain creating posts depicting nudity or sexual content,
        graphic violence and/or illicit activities. Members agree to our terms
        of use upon registering for an account. Violation of these terms will
        result in account deactivation and banishment from the Creature Collab
        realm.
